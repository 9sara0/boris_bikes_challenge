## Boris Bikes

This boris bikes challenge script allows you to run all the Docking Stations, simulate all the Bikes, and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

Script currently:
+ creates a docking station
+ creates bikes
+ controls the number of bikes that can be docked at a docking station
+ it releases working bikes when available.
